/**
 * @filter       Perspective
 * @description  Warps one quadrangle to another with a perspective transform. This can be used to
 *               make a 2D image look 3D or to recover a 2D image captured in a 3D environment.
 * @param before The x and y coordinates of four points before the transform in a flat list. This
 *               would look like [ax, ay, bx, by, cx, cy, dx, dy] for four points (ax, ay), (bx, by),
 *               (cx, cy), and (dx, dy).
 * @param after  The x and y coordinates of four points after the transform in a flat list, just
 *               like the other argument.
